# AutoMoto
AutoMoto is a sophisticated AI-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically tailored for AUTOSAR projects. It offers developers a user-friendly platform designed to streamline the design and configuration process within the AUTOSAR ecosystem.

A cornerstone of AUTOSAR is ARXML, which stands for "AUTOSAR XML." This standardized XML-based format is used in the automotive industry to describe software components and their interconnections within an AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) system. ARXML facilitates the creation, editing, and parsing of configuration and schema files.

AutoMoto ensures these files are validated against relevant schemas and subjected to various queries to provide insightful statistics. Unlike other configuration tools, AutoMoto boasts a unique feature: the ability to generate ARXML from English descriptions using AI. This capability significantly enhances the efficiency and accessibility of AUTOSAR project development.

# Main Features of the Tool

## Showing the Basic Software Module Definitions (BSWMD)
AutoMoto parses the BSWMD of AUTOSAR and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Pasring Any ARXML File
AutoMoto can parse ARXML files and display them in a user-friendly interface.

## Extracting ARXML
AutoMoto can edit any uploaded ARXML, edit it, and extract it.

## Validating ARXML Against the Schema
AutoMoto has a validator that does the following:
Validate the input file against ARXML Scehma
Validate that the input file has a correct XML hierarchy. 

## Generating the C and H files Corresponding to ARXML Configurations
AUtoMoto has a generator that converts ARXML into C and H files that are used in the ECUs.

## Generating ARXML from English Descriptions using AI
The most important feature of AutoMoto is its ability to generate ARXML from English prompts from the engineers based on a strong LLM.
